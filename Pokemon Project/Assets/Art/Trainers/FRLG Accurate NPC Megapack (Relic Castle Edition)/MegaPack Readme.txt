==========================================
Before I posted this for public use, it was very important for me to be able to give credit where credit is due.

Aside from the very minor edits I've done to "correct" certain errors to certain Sprites, 99.9% of all Sprites included in this
resource were made by someone else. All I did was adapt the majority of them to RMXP for use in Essentials.
Some of the files included were already adapted for Essentials elsewhere by someone else and were merely included for convenience.
For such cases, credit will be listed for them, as with all of the original Spriters, for this would not be possible without them.

How to Use:
All OW NPC files are to be put into the Graphics/Characters folder. 
All Trainer Front and Back Sprites are to be moved into the Graphics/Trainers folder.
All Playable Trainer Icon Sprites are to be moved into the Graphics/Pictures folder.
Rename files at your leisure, but make sure they match the PBS designations you assign them in said .txt files.

Crediting me for putting it together isn't necessary. I'd rather you credit the original Spriters.
Enjoy!
